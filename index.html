					<h2>CoreCLR: A Brief Overview</h2>
					<p>
						CoreCLR is the runtime component of .NET, a cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern, high-performance
						applications. It's responsible for executing .NET applications, managing memory, handling exceptions, and providing other
						essential runtime services.
					</p>
					<h3>Some benefits of CoreCLR are:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Cross-platform Compatibility</h4>
							<p>
								CoreCLR is designed to work on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions,
								enabling developers to write and run .NET applications on different platforms.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>High Performance</h4>
							<p>
								CoreCLR is optimized for performance, providing fast startup times and efficient execution of .NET applications. It
								achieves this through various techniques such as just-in-time (JIT) compilation, ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, and
								aggressive optimization.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Memory Management</h4>
							<p>
								CoreCLR includes a garbage collector (GC) responsible for automatically reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are
								no longer in use, thereby helping developers avoid memory leaks and manage memory efficiently.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Exception Handling</h4>
							<p>
								CoreCLR provides robust support for handling exceptions in .NET applications, allowing developers to write reliable
								and resilient code that can gracefully handle errors and failures.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Security</h4>
							<p>
								CoreCLR includes features for enhancing the security of .NET applications, such as code access security, sandboxing,
								and various security-related APIs for encryption, authentication, and authorization.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Integration with Visual Studio</h4>
							<p>
								CoreCLR seamlessly integrates with Visual Studio, Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE), providing
								developers with a rich set of tools and features for building, debugging, and deploying .NET applications.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Open Source</h4>
							<p>
								CoreCLR is open-source software, allowing developers to inspect its source code, contribute improvements, and
								customize it to suit their specific requirements.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Overall, CoreCLR plays a crucial role in the .NET ecosystem, providing a reliable and efficient runtime environment for
						building modern, cross-platform applications.

					<h3>The above textual content was written by ChatGPT</h3>
					<p>
						I asked ChatGPT to give me a rundown of the CoreCLR, and then I converted it to HTML. After auditing the text, I can say
						it is factually correct, however it leaves out details and relevant information.
